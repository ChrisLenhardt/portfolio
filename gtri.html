							<h2>My Experience with GTRI</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>First Rotation Spring 2025</h3>
						<p>
							In my first rotation I was introduced to the codebase through testing, verification, and experimentation. 
							During this semester of work I became familiar with creating python and bash scripts to automate testing,
							using APIs to integrate new features such as creating a full stack visual command and control center that
							utilized Cesium map data or a containarized test data capture application that could be plug and played with
							the system's current docker compose. All features I worked on directly benefited the progress to flushing out 
							the developed SDK and were delievered to sponsors for field testing.
						</p>
						<h3>Second Rotation Fall 2025</h3>
						<p>
							In my second rotation I'm working more closely with the testing framework and making improvements to test automation.
							Through the use of docker, pydantic models, and google protobuf I have made the framework more user friendly for 3rd party sponsors
							and robust with automatic config and networking verification. Currently my most significant contribution is an application that simulates
							a scripted command and control center by sending messages over a local network. Through the use of a suite of unit and feature tests we are
							able to verify networking and intended behaviors between vehicles.
